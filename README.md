Pull Horse names from a website

## Description

Use information from a public website to populate [a spreadsheet](./KY%20Derby%20Blank.xlsx).
with horse names.

## Notes

* The equibase format page changes during race day. When horses are scratched you lose information about their pole position, jockey, etc...
* This doesn't yet handle combined entries (like 1 and 1A) In that case we probably should put both names into the same column, since those are treated as the same horse.

race the first Saturday in May. Any gambling or wagering activity should be done only within the confines of Federal, State, and local laws.
